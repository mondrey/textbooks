# 3D Solids

## Introduction

So far, we’ve only looked at the geometry of flat, 2-dimensional objects like circles or rectangles – but we live in a three-dimensional world. Every object we see or touch has three __dimensions__.

::: column.grow

A point has zero dimensions. A point just specifies a location but it has no size.

A line has one dimension, we can measure its length (l), but it has no width or thickness.

A square has two dimensions, we can measure its length (l) and, perpendicular to that, its width (w).

A cube has three dimensions, we can measure its length (l); width (w); and perpendicular to both of those dimensions, we have its height (h).

Plane Geometry deals with points, lines, and two-dimensional (2D) shapes like polygons and circles which do not have any thickness. __Polygons__ are plane figures that have only length and width.

Solid Geometry is the study of three-dimensional (3D) shapes that have depth or thickness as well as length and width. Even a paper has a thickness and is a 3D shape, but since its thickness is so small, we often neglect it.

::: column.grow

As soon as humankind began constructing complex buildings, we needed solid geometry. In some Babylonian and Egyptian texts, you can see that they are concerned about the problems related to the sizes of the pyramids and other structures they have made.

Since then, architects have been using 3D geometry to define the spatial form of a building.  Nowadays, the design of buildings is continually advancing by combining different 3D shapes and their properties.

Just like we’ve classified flat geometric shapes into a few categories like polygons or quadrilaterals, we can classify 3D Solids into a few different types:

__A polyhedron is a three-dimensional geometric solid with flat sides. The plural of polyhedron is “polyhedra”.__
The word polyhedron comes from the Classical Greek as poly (many) + hedron (base, face)

Polyhedra have many different shapes and sizes like polygons.
They can be as simple as a cube or a pyramid, or as complex as a star polyhedron with lots of sides.

There are also some 3D solids like cylinders and cones that contain curved surfaces, they are called non-polyhedra.

The Flatland is an animated film based on Edwin Abbott’s book Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions. The movie revolves around the inability of 2D shapes to grasp the third dimension. Characters are circles, triangles, and squares living in a 2D world. Their reality is shattered when a sphere from the 3D World comes to visit.

### Cubes

One of the most common types of 3D solids is a cube.

{.todo} IMAGES

A cube is a 3d shape that has 6 faces all of which are [[squares]].

{.todo} IMAGE: Rubik's Cube

::: column.grow

For instance, The Rubik's Cube is a classic toy invented in 1974 by Hungarian architecture and design professor Erno Rubik.  Each of the faces of a Rubik’s cube contains 9 colored squares. 

Although one of the smaller cubes (the central one) is not exposed, if we count carefully, we see that the Rubik’s cube is made up of [[27]] smaller rotatable cubes arranged in a 3x3x3 grid.

A cube has all its sides of the same length. If the length of all its sides is 1 unit, then it is called a unit cube. Unit cubes can be stacked together to create different 3D solids.

The 3D solids below consist of unit cubes. Can we find out the number of cubes used in each one including the hidden cubes?

Rotate the solids below to find the number of cubes that used to build them.

### Cuboids

::: column.grow

As with a square being rectangle, a cube is a cuboid.

A __cuboid__ is a box-shaped, where all six sides are rectangles. For example, pizza, cereal or shoe boxes are all cuboids.

Cuboids are some of the most common polyhedra we use every day.

An average pizza box has dimensions as 33 cm x 33 cm x 4 cm. It means it has 33 cm in length, 33 cm in width, and 4 cm in height or depth.
Sometimes a cuboid has two square faces and four rectangular faces like most of the pizza boxes.

::: column.grow

According to a legend, there was a devastating plague in Greece in 430BC. The Delians (citizens of a Greek Island, Delos) went to the temple of Apollo who told them that the plague will stop when they ___double the volume of his altar.___

:::

We can find the volume of more complex shapes by determining how many cubes of volume 1 it contains. 

The Apollo’s altar was a cubical temple with dimensions of five meters as its length, width, and height.

The Delians doubled the sides of the altar, but the plague did not stop. What went wrong? 

One way to find the volume of a cuboid is to fill the cuboid with unit cubes.

Volume is the number of cubic units that fill a 3D region, without any gaps or overlaps.

---

Let’s look at Apollo’s altar. If the edge length of the original altar was 5 units, then its base is a 5x5 square that has [[25]] unit cubes.

::: column

{.todo} Image for now, 3d later

::: column.grow

We continue to fill the altar by adding more cubes. 
The first layer is a 5 x 5 square made up from [[25]] cubes.

:::

---

    // Page 10

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: Area filling animation

There will be [[5]] layers of 25 cubes.
There must be `5 x 25 = input(125)` cubes to fill the entire altar. 

__It means the original cubic altar has a volume of 125 cubic units.__

The Delians did not follow the instructions carefully. They [[doubled each side]] of the altar. 
Let’s see what happened when they doubled the sides. 

::: column

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: temple area cubes

::: column.grow

When we double the sides of the cıube as the Delians have done with the incorrect altar, there will be [[100]] cubes and [[10]] layers. Therefore, the second altar they built had a volume of [[1000]] cubic units.

Doubling the dimensions of a three-dimensional figure will increase its volume by a factor of [[8]]. 

The Delians did not double the altar - they made it 8 times bigger.

:::

They should have doubled the volume instead of the side lengths.

::: column

{.todo} IMAGE: base-height

::: column.grow

To find the volume of the cube, the number of cubes in the first layer is multiplied by the height. This first layer is called the base and usually refers to the top and bottom faces of the cube.

:::

---

    // Page 11

Recall the original altar. We counted [[25]] cubes in each layer. Alternatively, we could have calculated the [[ area | length | diagonal]] of the base. 
The number of layers we added constitutes the [[height]] of the altar. 

We calculated the volume of the cubic altar by multiplying [[Base Area]] and [[height]].

Base Area => `ABase = input(5) x input(5) =25 m^2` and height is 5 meters

`Volume = A_Base x h`

`Volume = 25 x 5 = input(125) m^3`

In other words, the volume of a cube is the product of its length, [[width]], and [[height]].

`Volume = length x width x height`

::: column

A cube has the same value as its length, width, and height. 
The volume of a cube with a side length of “a” units is 
`V = a • a • a = blank(x, "a3", "3a", "3 + a")`

Multiplying three edge lengths allows us to determine the volume of cube efficiently.

::: column

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: cube

:::

A cube with an edge length of 3 centimeters has a volume of [[27]] cubic centimeters, which we can write as 27 cm3.

A cube with an edge length of 4 inches has a volume of [[64]] cubic inches, which we can write as 64 [[in3]].

Volume is always measured in cubic units, such as cubic inches (in3), cubic feet [[ft3]], cubic centimeters (cm3), or cubic meters [[m3]].

Greek temples have a very predictable layout. At the center, there is a section called Cella that holds a statue of the God to which the temple is dedicated. The cella is surrounded by a long string of columns.  They are not always in cubic forms but mostly in cuboids.

    // Page 12

Helping to prevent any future conflicts, we can find a general method to find the volume of all cuboids?

{.todo} IMAGE: temple model

::: column

{.todo} IMAGE: floorplan

::: column

The first layer of the cuboid has [[24]] cubes. It means the base area is 24 square units.

[[Height]] tells us the number of layers it takes to stack up to the cuboid.

The total number of cubes to be used to create this cuboid is [[24 x 5 = 120]].

:::

The volume is 120 cubic units.

We again calculated the volume by multiplying [[Base Area]] and  [[Height]].

`Volume = Base Area x height`
`V = A_Base x h`

In other words, the formula for the volume of all cuboids is the [[product]] of its three dimensions.

`Volume = length x width x height`
`V = l x w x h`

Now it’s your turn – find the volumes of the following cuboids.

Some cuboids may have the same volume although they have different shapes.

::: column

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: Shape-making

::: column

Use the unit cubes to create a cuboid so that the volume is 24 cubic units.

It is [[ not possible | possible]] to create a cube by using 24 unit cubes since 24 is not a perfect cube number.

How many different cuboids can you create by using 24 cubes?

[[Text Box]]

:::

By finding the missing dimensions of the different cuboids with a volume of 24 cubic units, we can observe how the base area and the height change when we have a certain amount of cubes to create the volume.

{.todo} Table

    // Page 14

{.todo} IMAGE: left column

If the base area of a cuboid smaller than the other, then its height has to be [[bigger | smaller | equal to]] to have the same volume.

If two cuboids have the same height, then the one with the greater base area has a [[greater]] volume.

We now know about how to find the volume of the cuboids, can we find another measure about them as well?

To use these, you put the word "figure" then "x-voxel-painter()" indented beneath it. Between the brackets, you can do the following:
1. To control the size of the applet in pixels, put width= and height= numbers
2. To control how big the grid at the bottom is, i.e. how wide and broad you can make things and how zoomed in we'll be, add playingFieldSize = desired width in grid squares
3. If you don't want a grid at all, put hideGrid
4. You may want to make a certain shape yourself, and then have that appear in a window and not be editable.
  To do this, you first need to make the shape. You can do this in the first figure on this page.
  When you've made it, click the check mark and copy the comma-separated list it gives you
  In the place you want the shape-on-its-own to appear, make your figure. Paste in shape= "..." into the brackets, putting in what you copied
  That applet should now contain just the thing you made
5. If you don't want the students to be adding anything to what they see, so put rotateOnly
6. If you want no interaction at all, even rotating, put noInteraction
7. To have the color of interior cubs shown sometimes, have "explodeOnGrab" as well. Warning: this induces "rotateOnly" mode

### Examples

Take a look at this cube. Some of the faces, the ones on the inside you'll see, are grey. The ones that aren't grey are on its surface. How many non-grey faces are there?

    figure
      x-voxel-painter(width=600 height=400 color-sides,shape="-0.5,-0.5,-0.5,0.5,-0.5,-0.5,-0.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5,-0.5,0.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,-0.5,0.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5,-0.5,",playingFieldSize="4",hideGrid,rotateOnly,explodeOnGrab)

The following can be used to create and save:
